# HomeFull

Homeless + Hopefull = HomeFull

## Overview

This was one of my first school projects with my partner, @alrebellato. As part of our project, we decided to focus
on Homelessness, which is often an under-reported social issue in Australia.

## Tech Stack

Our dynamic webpage drew upon frontend knowledge (HTML, CSS) alongside the backend (Javalin, Maven, Database Architecture + Modelling
as well as Database Creation + Querying).

During the ideation stage, we have targeted the website towards 3 main personas:
 
 1. The regular user, who would like a glimpse of the homeless situation in australia.
 2. The concerened user, who is after a bigger picture.
 3. The professional (data scientist), who would like access to large amounts of data for reports/research.


## Run

To run the webpage, execute `App.java`, after building the project with Maven.
